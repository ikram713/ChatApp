💬 Real-Time Chat App
I created this project while learning Socket.IO, to understand how real-time communication works in modern web apps. It’s a simple but functional real-time chat application built with:

⚙️ Node.js + Express.js

🌐 Socket.IO for real-time WebSocket communication

💾 MongoDB to store chat history

🧩 Modular structure for scalability

🎨 A simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🚀 Features:
💬 Real-time chat between users

🏠 Join and chat in custom rooms

💾 Chat messages are saved in MongoDB

📥 Automatically loads message history when you join a room

👋 Notifies when users join or leave

🧱 Clean project structure (routes, config, models, utils)

🖥️ Simple and lightweight frontend for easy interaction
